# Chroot:  Creating Directories 
# This section is done in Chroot environment

# It is time to create the full directory structure in the LFS 
# file system. 

# Create a standard directory tree by issuing the following commands: 
mkdir -pv /{boot,etc/{opt,sysconfig},home,mnt,opt}
mkdir -pv /{media/{floppy,cdrom},srv,var}
mkdir -pv /usr/{,local/}{bin,include,lib,sbin,src}
mkdir -pv /usr/{,local/}share/{color,dict,doc,info,locale,man}
mkdir -pv /usr/{,local/}share/{misc,terminfo,zoneinfo}
mkdir -pv /usr/{,local/}share/man/man{1..8}
mkdir -pv /var/{log,mail,spool}
mkdir -pv /var/{opt,cache,lib/{color,misc,locate},local}
mkdir -v  /usr/libexec
mkdir -pv /usr/lib32
mkdir -pv /usr/lib/firmware

ln -sv usr/bin   /bin
ln -sv usr/sbin  /sbin
ln -sv usr/lib   /lib
ln -sv usr/lib32 /lib32
ln -sv /run      /var/run
ln -sv /run/lock /var/lock

install -dv -m 0750 /root
install -dv -m 1777 /tmp /var/tmp


# Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755, 
# but this is not desirable everywhere. In the commands above, 
# two changes are made—one to the home directory of user root, 
# and another to the directories for temporary files. 

# The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter 
# the /root directory—just like a normal user would do with his 
# or her own home directory. The second mode change makes sure 
# that any user can write to the /tmp and /var/tmp directories, 
# but cannot remove another user's files from them. The latter 
# is prohibited by the so-called “sticky bit,” the highest 
# bit (1) in the 1777 bit mask.
