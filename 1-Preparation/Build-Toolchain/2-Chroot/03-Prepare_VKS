# Chroot: Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems
# Run as root or super user

# Applications running in userspace utilize various file systems 
# created by the kernel to communicate with the kernel itself. 
# These file systems are virtual: no disk space is used for 
# them. The content of these file systems resides in memory. 
# These file systems must be mounted in the $LFS directory 
# tree so the applications can find them in the chroot environment

# Begin by creating the directories on which these virtual file 
# systems will be mounted:
mkdir -pv $LFS/{dev,proc,sys,run}

# Mounting and Populating /dev

# During a normal boot of an LFS system, the kernel 
# automatically mounts the devtmpfs file system on the 
# /dev directory; the kernel creates device nodes on that 
# virtual file system during the boot process, or when a 
# device is first detected or accessed. The udev daemon may 
# change the ownership or permissions of the device nodes 
# created by the kernel, and create new device nodes or 
# symlinks, to ease the work of distro maintainers and 
# system administrators. If the host kernel supports devtmpfs, 
# we can simply mount a devtmpfs at $LFS/dev and rely on the 
# kernel to populate it.

# But some host kernels lack devtmpfs support; these host 
# distros use different methods to create the content of /dev. 
# So the only host-agnostic way to populate the $LFS/dev directory 
# is by bind mounting the host system's /dev directory. A bind 
# mount is a special type of mount that makes a directory 
# subtree or a file visible at some other location. Use the 
# following command to do this.
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev

# Mounting Virtual Kernel File Systems

# Now mount the remaining virtual kernel file systems: 
mount -vt devpts devpts -o gid=5,mode=0620 $LFS/dev/pts
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
mount -vt tmpfs tmpfs $LFS/run

# In some host systems, /dev/shm is a symbolic link to a 
# directory, typically /run/shm. The /run tmpfs was mounted 
# above so in this case only a directory needs to be created 
# with the correct permissions.

# In other host systems /dev/shm is a mount point for a tmpfs. 
# In that case the mount of /dev above will only create 
# /dev/shm as a directory in the chroot environment. 
# In this situation we must explicitly mount a tmpfs: 
if [ -h $LFS/dev/shm ]; then
  install -v -d -m 1777 $LFS$(realpath /dev/shm)
else
  mount -vt tmpfs -o nosuid,nodev tmpfs $LFS/dev/shm
fi
