# Chroot: Creating Essential Files and Symlinks 
# This section is done in Chroot environment

# Some programs use hard-wired paths to programs which do 
# not exist yet. In order to satisfy these programs, 
# create a number of symbolic links which will be replaced 
# by real files throughout the course of this chapter 
# after the software has been installed:
ln -sv /tools/bin/{bash,cat,chmod,dd,echo,ln,mkdir,pwd,rm,stty,touch} /bin
ln -sv /tools/bin/{env,install,perl,printf}         /usr/bin
ln -sv /tools/lib/libgcc_s.so{,.1}                  /usr/lib
ln -sv /tools/lib/libstdc++.{a,so{,.6}}             /usr/lib

ln -sv bash /bin/sh

# Historically, Linux maintains a list of the mounted file 
# systems in the file /etc/mtab. Modern kernels maintain this 
# list internally and exposes it to the user via the /proc 
# filesystem. To satisfy utilities that expect the presence 
# of /etc/mtab, create the following symbolic link: 
ln -sv /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab

# Create a basic /etc/hosts file to be referenced in some test 
# suites, and in one of Perl's configuration files as well:
cat > /etc/hosts << EOF
127.0.0.1  localhost $(hostname)
::1        localhost
EOF

# In order for user root to be able to login and for the name 
# “root” to be recognized, there must be relevant entries in 
# the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.

# Create the /etc/passwd file by running the following command: 
cat > /etc/passwd << "EOF"
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:6:6:Daemon User:/dev/null:/usr/bin/false
messagebus:x:18:18:D-Bus Message Daemon User:/run/dbus:/usr/bin/false
uuidd:x:80:80:UUID Generation Daemon User:/dev/null:/usr/bin/false
nobody:x:65534:65534:Unprivileged User:/dev/null:/usr/bin/false
EOF

# The actual password for root will be set later. 

# Create the /etc/group file by running the following command: 
cat > /etc/group << "EOF"

# Some tests in next stage need a regular user. We add this 
# user here and delete this account at the end of that stage.
echo "tester:x:101:101::/home/tester:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
echo "tester:x:101:" >> /etc/group
install -o tester -d /home/tester

# To remove the “I have no name!” prompt, start a new shell. Since 
# the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files have been created, user 
# name and group name resolution will now work.
exec /tools/bin/bash --login

# The login, agetty, and init programs (and others) use a number 
# of log files to record information such as who was logged into 
# the system and when. However, these programs will not write to 
# the log files if they do not already exist. Initialize the log 
# files and give them proper permissions:
touch /var/log/{btmp,lastlog,faillog,wtmp}
chgrp -v utmp /var/log/lastlog
chmod -v 664  /var/log/lastlog
chmod -v 600  /var/log/btmp

# The /var/log/wtmp file records all logins and logouts. The 
# /var/log/lastlog file records when each user last logged in. 
# The /var/log/faillog file records failed login attempts. The 
# /var/log/btmp file records the bad login attempts.

# NOTE:  The /run/utmp file records the users that are currently 
# logged in. This file is created dynamically in the boot scripts.

# NOTE: The utmp, wtmp, btmp, and lastlog files use 32-bit 
# integers for timestamps and they'll be fundamentally broken 
# after year 2038. Many packages have stopped using them and 
# other packages are going to stop using them. It is probably 
# best to consider them deprecated.
