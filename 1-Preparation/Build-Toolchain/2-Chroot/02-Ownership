# Tools: Changing Ownership
# Run as root or super user

# NOTE: The commands in the remainder of this book must be 
# performed while logged in as user root and no longer as 
# user lfs. Also, double check that $LFS is set in root's 
# environment. 

# Currently, the $LFS/tools directory is owned by the user 
# lfs, a user that exists only on the host system. If the 
# $LFS/tools directory is kept as is, the files are owned 
# by a user ID without a corresponding account. This is 
# dangerous because a user account created later could 
# get this same user ID and would own the $LFS/tools 
# directory and all the files therein, thus exposing 
# these files to possible malicious manipulation.

# To avoid this issue, you could add the lfs user to the 
# new LFS system later when creating the /etc/passwd file, 
# taking care to assign it the same user and group IDs as 
# on the host system. Better yet, change the ownership of 
# the $LFS/tools directory to user root by running the 
# following command:
chown -R root:root $LFS/tools

# Although the $LFS/tools directory can be deleted once 
# the LFS system has been finished, it can be retained to 
# build additional LFS systems of the same book version. 
# How best to backup $LFS/tools is a matter of personal 
# preference.
