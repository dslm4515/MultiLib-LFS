# Cross-Tools: Kernel Headers
# Build & install as user lfs

# Clean sources
make mrproper

# Extract the headers
make headers

# Install headers for both cross-tools & tools
# *NOTE* Since host & target are on the same CPU
# architecture, install headers to /tools and 
# both for cross-tools & tools to use
cp -rv usr/include /tools/
cp -rv usr/include /cross-tools/

# Clean up the installed headers by removing
# any files non-headers:
find /tools/include -type f ! -name '*.h' -delete
find /cross-tools/include -type f ! -name '*.h' -delete
