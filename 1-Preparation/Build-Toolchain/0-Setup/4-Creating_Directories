# Create a limited directory hierarchy, so that the programs compiled in later 
# (as well as glibc and libstdc++) can be installed in their final location. 

# Create the required directory layout by issuing the following commands as root: 
mkdir -pv $LFS/{etc,var} $LFS/usr/{bin,lib,sbin}

for i in bin lib sbin; do
  ln -sv usr/$i $LFS/$i
done

case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64) mkdir -pv $LFS/lib64 ;;
esac

mkdir -pv $LFS/usr/lib{,x}32
ln -sv usr/lib32 $LFS/lib32
ln -sv usr/libx32 $LFS/libx32

# A cross-compiler will be installed in a special directory, to separate it from 
# the other programs. Still acting as root, create that directory with this command: 
mkdir -pv $LFS/tools

# NOTE: A /usr/lib64 directory will not be used. If for any reason this directory 
# appears (either because you made an error in following the instructions, or 
# because you installed a binary package that created it after finishing LFS), it 
# may break your system. You should always be sure this directory does not exist.
