# All programs compiled in Stage 1 will be installed under 
# $LFS/tools to keep them separate from the programs 
# compiled in Stage 3. The programs compiled here are 
# temporary tools and will not be a part of the final LFS 
# system. By keeping these programs in a separate directory, 
# they can easily be discarded later after their use. This 
# also prevents these programs from ending up in the host 
# production directories (easy to do by accident in Stage 1).

# Create a directories for stage 0, the cross-tools, and stage 1,
#  as root:
mkdir -v $LFS/{cross-,}tools

# The next step is to create a symlinks on the host 
# system. This will point to the newly-created directories on 
# the LFS partition. Run this command as root as well:
ln -sv $LFS/tools       /
ln -sv $LFS/cross-tools /

# The created symlinks enables the toolchain to be compiled so 
# that it always refers to /tools, meaning that the compiler, 
# assembler, and linker will work both in later (when we 
# are still using some tools from the host) and in the next 
# (when we are “chrooted” to the LFS partition).

# Create additional directories for this multi-lib build
mkdir -pv $LFS/tools/lib{,64,32}
