# All programs compiled in '1-Tools' will be installed under $LFS/tools to keep 
# them separate from the programs compiled in 2-Chroot. The programs compiled 
# here are temporary tools and will not be a part of the final LFS system. By 
# keeping these programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded 
# later after their use. This also prevents these programs from ending up in 
# the host production directories (easy to do by accident in 1-Tools'). 

# Create the required directory by running the following as root:
mkdir -v $LFS/tools

# The next step is to create a /tools symlink on the host system. This will 
# point to the newly-created directory on the LFS partition. Run this command 
# as root as well:
ln -sv $LFS/tools /

# The created symlink enables the toolchain to be compiled so that it always 
# refers to /tools, meaning that the compiler, assembler, and linker will work 
# both in '1-Tools' (when we are still using some tools from the host) and in 
# the next (when we are “chrooted” to the LFS partition).
