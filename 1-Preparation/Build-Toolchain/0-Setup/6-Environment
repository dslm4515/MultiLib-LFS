# Set up a good working environment by creating two new startup 
# files for the bash shell. While logged in as user lfs, issue 
# the following command to create a new .bash_profile:
cat > ~/.bash_profile << "EOF"
exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
EOF

# When logged on as user lfs, the initial shell is usually a 
# login shell which reads the /etc/profile of the host (probably 
# containing some settings and environment variables) and then 
# .bash_profile. The exec env -i.../bin/bash command in the 
# .bash_profile file replaces the running shell with a new one 
# with a completely empty environment, except for the HOME, 
# TERM, and PS1 variables. This ensures that no unwanted and 
# potentially hazardous environment variables from the host 
# system leak into the build environment. The technique used 
# here achieves the goal of ensuring a clean environment.

# The new instance of the shell is a non-login shell, which 
# does not read the /etc/profile or .bash_profile files, but 
# rather reads the .bashrc file instead. Create the .bashrc 
# file now:
cat > ~/.bashrc << "EOF"

# The set +h command turns off bash's hash function. Hashing 
# is ordinarily a useful feature—bash uses a hash table to 
# remember the full path of executable files to avoid 
# searching the PATH time and again to find the same 
# executable. However, the new tools should be used as 
# soon as they are installed. By switching off the hash 
# function, the shell will always search the PATH when a 
# program is to be run. As such, the shell will find the 
# newly compiled tools in $LFS/tools as soon as they are 
# available without remembering a previous version of the 
# same program in a different location.

# Setting the user file-creation mask (umask) to 022 ensures 
# that newly created files and directories are only writable 
# by their owner, but are readable and executable by anyone 
# (assuming default modes are used by the open(2) system call, 
# new files will end up with permission mode 644 and 
# directories with mode 755).

# The LFS variable should be set to the chosen mount point.

# The LC_ALL variable controls the localization of certain 
# programs, making their messages follow the conventions of 
# a specified country. Setting LC_ALL to “POSIX” or “C” (the 
# two are equivalent) ensures that everything will work as 
# expected in the chroot environment.

# The LFS_TGT variable sets a non-default, but compatible 
# machine description for use when building our cross compiler 
# and linker and when cross compiling our temporary toolchain. 
# More information is contained in “Toolchain Technical Notes”
#... in the LFS book.

# By putting /tools/bin ahead of the standard PATH, all the 
# programs installed in Stage 1 are picked up by the shell 
# immediately after their installation. This, combined with 
# turning off hashing, limits the risk that old programs are 
# used from the host when the same programs are available in 
# the chrooted environment.

# If CONFIG_SITE variable is not set, configure scripts may 
# attempt to load configuration items specific to some 
# distributions from /usr/share/config.site on the host 
# system. Override it to prevent potential contamination 
# from the host.

# Finally, to have the environment fully prepared for building 
# the temporary tools, source the just-created user profile:
source ~/.bash_profile
