# Tools: Kernel headers
# Build & install as LFS

# Make sure there are no stale files embedded in the package:
make mrproper

# Now extract the user-visible kernel headers from the source. 
# The recommended make target “headers_install” cannot be used, 
# because it requires rsync, which may not be available. The 
# headers are first placed in ./usr, then copied to the needed 
# location.
make headers
find usr/include -type f ! -name '*.h' -delete
cp -rv usr/include $LFS/usr
